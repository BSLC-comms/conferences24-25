Title: Stat Leadership at Every Level: Embracing the Trends of Innovation

Abstract:

In an era where artificial intelligence, digital technologies, and diverse data types are rapidly transforming the pharmaceutical landscape, statisticians often find themselves navigating a complex and overwhelming array of innovations. This surge presents both challenges and opportunities to integrate new methodologies without losing sight of the critical thinking and analytical rigor that define our profession.

In this session, Supported by the Biopharma Statistics Leadership Consortium, we plan to bring together three senior leaders from pharmaceutical data science organizations to share their insights on harmonizing established statistical practices with novel AI-driven tools. 

We will explore what embracing these trends means for professionals at various stages of their careers:

- Junior Statisticians: How to effectively contribute to clinical trials while integrating new data types and technologies.
- Senior Statisticians: Techniques for overseeing multiple projects that blend established methods with innovative approaches.
- People Managers: Guidance on leading teams through change, fostering a culture of adaptability, and leveraging both old and new tools for decision-making.
